# Election Analysis

## Project Overview
An employee from the Colorado Board of Elections asked me to audit a local congressional election via Python. The script written for this audit was then be applied to other elections where the data is stored in the same format. The application will display the data in the terminal as well as write them to a text file. The information requested is as follows:

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast. 
2. Compile a complete list of candidates which received votes.
3. Find the total number of votes for each candidate.
4. Find the vote percentage for each candidate.
5. Determine the election winner via popular vote.
